# AI PROJECTS

My collection of AI-based personal projects

* [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/connortodd21/ai_projects/tree/master/tic-tac-toe)
  * Tic Tac Toe game using reinforcement learning via self play and back propogation. You can play against the pre-trained AI (which helps train it more) or train it yourself for n iterations

* [Blackjack](https://github.com/connortodd21/ai_projects/tree/master/blackjack)
  * Blackjack simulation to display the best stop policy using Monte Carlo sampling. A stop policy is defined as the card number for which a user will always stop 'hitting'.
